    <title>They say that only the name is long enough to attract attention. They also said that only a simple Kata will have someone to solve it. This is a sadly story #1: Are they opposite?</title>

        Task<br>
        Give you two strings: s1 and s2. If they are opposite, return true; otherwise, return false. <br>
        Note: The result should be a boolean value, instead of a string.<br>
        <br>
        The opposite means: All letters of the two strings are the same, but the case is opposite. <br>
        you can assume that the string only contains letters or it's a empty string. Also take note <br>
        of the edge case - if both strings are empty then you should return false/False.<br>
        <br>
        Examples (input -> output)<br>
        "ab","AB"     -> true<br>
        "aB","Ab"     -> true<br>
        "aBcd","AbCD" -> true<br>
        "AB","Ab"     -> false<br>
        "",""         -> false<br>
